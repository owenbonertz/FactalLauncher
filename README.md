# FactalLauncher

I'm trying to streamline the process by which Factal editors open all of their tabs when assigned a region.

I'm using the webbrowser module to quickly open the tabs that 99% of editors use. 

When this is complete, you will be able to take the regions and specific country lists you need open and feed them as command line arguments
